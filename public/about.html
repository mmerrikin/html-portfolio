<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I have always enjoyed using computers and playing video games since a young age. My grandfather really encouraged me to engage in the new technology as it came out when I was a child. From this I have developed a life long enjoyment of using technology.</p>

<p> During my work experience I have spent the majority of my adult career within electrical wholesale. My recent job role has been more focused on stock management. As I have grown and settled into my adult life, I recognise the importance in doing and pursuing what you enjoy, therefore I have started online coding in 2023.  </p>
